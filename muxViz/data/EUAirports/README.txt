By using this data set, you agree not to perform reverse engineering to extract airlines, airport names, or any other information, and not to perform comparative studies about the performance of different air transport actors.

This dataset is exactly the complete set used in the paper: "Emergence of network features from multiplexity" by Cardillo et al. appeared on the magazine Scientific Reports (nature open access), number 3 in 2013. It contains the structure of a multilayer network composed by thirty-seven different layers each one corresponding to a different airline operating in Europe.
